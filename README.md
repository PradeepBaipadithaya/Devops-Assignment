## Hospital Mangement System Usecases

1) **Admin Dashboard:**
   - The admin dashboard serves as the centralized control panel for the hospital management system. It allows administrators to:
     - Manage user roles and permissions.
     - View overall hospital statistics such as the number of patients, appointmentsetc.
     - Manage hospital resources such as doctors, nurses, and facilities.

2) **Register/Add New Patient's Info (Receptionist):**
   - The receptionist, upon a patient's arrival, registers the patient into the system by collecting their personal information, medical history, insurance details, etc.
   - The receptionist inputs this data into the hospital management application, creating a new patient record.
   - This use case ensures that all necessary information about the patient is accurately recorded and easily accessible for future reference.

3) **Appointment Scheduling (Receptionist):**
   - The receptionist manages appointment scheduling by:
     - Checking the availability of doctors and time slots.
     - Booking appointments for patients either via phone, in-person, or through an online portal.
     - Sending appointment reminders to patients via SMS or email.
   - This use case helps in efficient utilization of doctors' time and ensures patients receive timely care.

4) **Accessing Previous Visits History (Doctor):**
   - When a doctor sees a patient, they need access to the patient's previous visit history to make informed decisions about their current treatment.
   - The doctor can easily access the patient's medical records, including past diagnoses, medications, test results, and treatments, through the hospital management application.
   - This use case facilitates continuity of care and helps doctors provide personalized treatment plans.

5) **Generating Prescription and Automatic Transmission (Doctor):**
   - After diagnosing a patient, the doctor can generate a prescription directly within the hospital management application.
   - Once the prescription is generated, it is automatically transmitted to the receptionist for printing.
   - This use case streamlines the prescription process, reducing errors and ensuring that patients receive their medications promptly.

6) **Removing Patient from OPD Queue (Doctor, Receptionist):**
   - In case a patient needs to be removed from the OPD (Outpatient Department) queue due to various reasons such as emergency cases or rescheduling, both the doctor and the receptionist can perform this action.
   - Removing a patient from the queue frees up the doctor's time for other patients and prevents unnecessary waiting for the patient who needs urgent attention.
   - This use case ensures efficient management of patient flow and prioritization of cases based on urgency.
